We have the department with the most homicides, the time range where most of them occur and the locations. A quick measure that can be taken is to increase police presence.

We also identified that the majority of homicides are between known persons and by firearms. From my point of view it would be interesting to request information from the police and find out if there was a previous report or if the weapons were legal in order to go deeper into the analysis.
